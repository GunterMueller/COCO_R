This directory contains an outline of the use of Coco/R to derive a simple
spreadsheet application.

The version in this directory uses traditional Coco/R, assuming the FileIO
library to be available, and require the CRFRAMES environment variable to
point to C:\COCO\FRAMES (or equivalent). Sources for FileIO for your compiler
can be found in the C:\SOURCES directory and its subdirectories.
