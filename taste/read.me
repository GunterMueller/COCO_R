These three applications demonstrate  the use of Coco for building a simple
compiler/interpreter, a cross reference generator, and a pretty printer for a
simple Algol-like language "Taste", designed as a tutorial by Hanspeter
Moessenboeck, author of Coco/R.  The versions in this directory use traditional
Coco/R, assuming the FileIO library to be available, and require the
CRFRAMES environment variable to point to C:\COCO\FRAMES (or equivalent).
Sources for FileIO for your compiler can be found in the C:\SOURCES directory
and its subdirectories.
